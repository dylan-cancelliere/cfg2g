## **Local Setup**

pnpm i --frozen-lockfile

4. (Optional) If you need to make changes to the backend code, get in contact with me in the SJP Discord @Dylan, an invite is linked on the site.

## **Code Style**

All code should conform to [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) style guidelines and the [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) specification in order to be considered for merge.

There is likely a plugins for each tool in your editor, but you can also run the following in the root directory in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm run pre-commit
```

## **Contributing**

Code should be made by forking the project and submitting a pull request. Also very interested in feature requests, so feel free to drop an issue here or make a thread in the #website-discussion Discord channel.

Contributing information on companies is currently limited to membership, however there is a feature planned to allow submission from the general public.

If you're a part of a different SJP or similar organization and are interested in getting a similar page tailored to your school, please reach out! We'd be thrilled to lend a hand, tech support or otherwise.
